## Local development setup

- You will need to install [Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot#install).
- For a no frills build: `boot build`. You will find the assets in the `target/` directory.
- To serve those assets: `boot serve`.
- Run `boot dev` to get a development environment going.
- Do `boot repl --client` then `(start-repl)` to start the browser connected repl.
